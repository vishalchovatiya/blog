Hi, I'm [**Vishal**](https://www.vishalchovatiya.com/vishal-chovatiya/) [](https://www.vishalchovatiya.com/vishal-chovatiya/)— Experienced Enthusiast For: C++, System Software, Firmware, SoC Modeling & Leadership.

I am a techie who writes software in Assembly/C/C++(11/14/17)/SystemC/Python along with any other technologies that are needed to get things done. I also dabble in blogging, leadership, technical writing & application programming when time permits.

At present, leading a team on a technical front along with non-technical nuisances, to create a high impact on individual team member’s career growth while considering corporate accountability also. And that’s where I am losing most of my valuable time these days.

Apart from technical things, I find myself excellent in technical recruitment, competency-based interviewing, leadership & project ownership.

Some of the words that describe me the best: Software Developer⌨, Tech-Lead?‍✈️, Product Owner?, Fitness Freak?, Geek?, Hipster?, Blogger?‍?, Productivity Hacker⌚, Technical Writer✍️, Tech talker?‍?, Leader?‍?, Manager?, Mentor??‍?, Always a Student?‍?, Incomplete? & Learning Junkie?.
