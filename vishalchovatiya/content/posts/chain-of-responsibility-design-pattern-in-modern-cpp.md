Chain of Responsibility is a Behavioural Design Pattern that **_provides facility to propagate event/request/command/query to the chain of loosely coupled objects_**. Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern in Modern C++ lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers & upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to forward it to the next handler in the chain.

By the way, If you havenâ€™t check out my other articles on Behavioural Design Patterns, then here is the list:

{{% include "/reusable_block/behavioural-design-patterns.md" %}}
{{% include "/reusable_block/design-pattern-prerequisites.md" %}}

## Intent

> **_To provide the chance to handle the request by more than one object/component._**

- Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern is a chain of loosely coupled objects who all get a chance to process command/query. And they may have some sort of default processing implementation and/or they can also terminate the processing chain and thereby preventing propagation of the event to the rest of the objects.
- In other words, its **_processing pipeline where you just launch-and-leave_**.

## Classic Examples for Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern in C++

- A typical use-case for Chain of Responsibility is the login process. That requires a certain number of steps to complete successfully like user name, password, captcha, etc. to matched properly. Consider the following traditional example for the same:

```cpp
struct Authentication {
	Authentication*     m_next{nullptr};

	virtual bool authenticate() = 0;
	void next_authentication(Authentication *nextAuth) { m_next = nextAuth; }
};

struct UserName : Authentication {
	string      m_name;

	UserName(string name) : m_name(name){}
	bool is_valid_user_name() { return true; }
	bool authenticate() {
		if(!is_valid_user_name()) {
			cout << "Invalid user name" << endl;
            return false;
		}
        else if(m_next) return m_next->authenticate();
        return true;
	}
};

struct Password : Authentication {
	string      m_password;

	Password(string password) : m_password(password){}
	bool is_valid_password() { return true; }
	bool authenticate() {
        if(!is_valid_password()) {
			cout << "Invalid password" << endl;
            return false;
		}
        else if(m_next) return m_next->authenticate();
        return true;
	}
};

int main() {
	Authentication *login{new UserName("John")};
	login->next_authentication(new Password("password"));
	login->authenticate();
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

- I know this is not a very good example but sufficient to convey an idea of Chain of Responsibility. As you can see above, Login is a single process which requires multiple subprocesses to be carried out like username & password authentication.
- So in our case `login->authenticate();` fires the chain of responsibility to verify each step required for login one-by-one.
- You can also add more steps in the login process, for example, to add captcha, create captcha class inherited with `Authentication` & add that class object pointer in the login's next authentication chain as we did for `UserName` & `Password`.
- Now before we move on to the more sophisticated implementations I just wanted to mention the fact that this particular implementation of a chain of responsibility seems quite artificial. Because essentially what's happening here is you're building a singly linked list so the question is well why not just use a `std::list` or a `std::vector`. It's certainly a very valid concern. But as I mentioned earlier, this is how people used to build chain irresponsibilities.

## Boost Example for Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern

- What you going to see now is a modern way of implementing the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern that is known as [Event Broker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker_pattern). Which is actually a combination of several design patterns like [Command](/posts/command-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/), [Mediator](/posts/mediator-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/) & [Observer](/posts/observer-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
#include <boost/signals2.hpp>
//using namespace boost::signals2;

struct Query {                          // Command
    int32_t     m_cnt{0};
};

struct EventObserver {                  // Observer
    boost::signals2::signal<void(Query &)>       m_handlers;
};

struct ExampleClass : EventObserver {   // Mediator
    void generate_event() { 
        cout << "Event generated" << endl;
        Query   q;
        m_handlers(q); 
        cout << endl;
    }
};

struct BaseHandler {
    ExampleClass&       m_example;
};

struct Handler_1 : BaseHandler {
    boost::signals2::connection      m_conn;

    Handler_1(ExampleClass &example) : BaseHandler{example}
    {
        m_conn = m_example.m_handlers.connect([&](Query &q) {
            cout << "Serving by Handler_1 : count = " << ++q.m_cnt << endl;
        });
    }
    ~Handler_1() { m_conn.disconnect(); }
};

struct Handler_2 : BaseHandler {
    boost::signals2::connection      m_conn;

    Handler_2(ExampleClass &example) : BaseHandler{example}
    {
        m_conn = m_example.m_handlers.connect([&](Query &q) {
            cout << "Serving by Handler_2 : count = " << ++q.m_cnt << endl;
        });
    }
    ~Handler_2() { m_conn.disconnect(); }
};

int main() {
    ExampleClass example;
    Handler_1 applyThisHandlerOn{example};

    example.generate_event();       // Will be served by Handler_1

    { 
        Handler_2 TemporaryHandler{example};
        example.generate_event();   // Will be served by Handler_1 & Handler_2
    }

    example.generate_event();       // Will be served by Handler_1
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
/*
Event generated
Serving by Handler_1 : count = 1

Event generated
Serving by Handler_1 : count = 1
Serving by Handler_2 : count = 2

Event generated
Serving by Handler_1 : count = 1
*/
```

- So as you can see, we have `ExampleClass` which generates an event & having `boost::signal2` as an observer. We have `Query`(i.e. [Command Design Pattern](/posts/command-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/)) to pass between all the register handlers.
- Then we have handler arrangement which registers the [lambda function](/posts/learn-lambda-function-in-cpp-with-example/) to handle the event in constructor & same will be de-register in the destructor.
- In main, we have facilitated the ad-hoc registration of handlers just by declaring objects which process the `Query` passed in `ExampleClass::generate_event()` Handler automatically de-registers itself when it goes out of scope thanks to [RAII](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii).

## Benefits of Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern

1. Decouples the sender & receiver as we saw a more sophisticated approach using [Mediator](/posts/mediator-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/) & [Command Design Pattern](/posts/command-design-pattern-in-modern-cpp/).
2. Simplifies code as the object which is generating event does not need to know the chain structure & command/query.
3. Enhances flexibility of object assigned duties. By changing the members within the chain or change their order, allow dynamically adding or deleting responsibility.
4. Increase extensibility as adding a new handler is very convenient.

## Summary by FAQs

**Can I use(or Difference) Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern over Decorator?**

- When you in need of multiple Decorator.  
- While you want to add new functionality dynamically.  
- When you want a change of order in functionality configurable.  
- For example, you created Decorator of `WalkingAnimal` & `BarkingAnimal` of `Animal`, and now you want both combined at run-time. In such case Chain of Responsibility would be the right choice.

**When should I use Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern?**

- When there is more than one object to service a request.  
- These objects & its order determined at run time on the basis of request type.  
- When you do not want to bind request & handler tightly.
